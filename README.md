# ADEMT
This project is based off of my notes in Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TC3) and (Algorithm Directed Troop Medical Care) ADTMC.  This isn't intended as a legal guide nor is it intended to be used for anything other than a basis to do more research.  That said, I will be adding notes and citations to resources where the information is located.  This is only for a quick reference.

When I was in Iraq I created a hip pocket guide that I used to help me with almost everything I learned as a medic.  There is a book that came out after I left (I'm sure not inspired by my work) called the Combat Medic Field Reference (CMFR).  It is a good hip pocket guide.  However it was released in 2005 and hasn't been updated.  I loved ADTMC as it provided a lot of information for clinical work and gave you a way to handle it.  My book detailed much more.

There are apps and you can find some pocket guides for BLS and ALS.  So why is this different?

The main difference is the small spiral-bound pocket guides are a concise reference.  The ADTMC is for clinical.  The CMFR guide and TC3 are geared towards military use and not as an EMT-B, AEMT, or paramedic.

What I want is a book for new EMTs, even those going through any of the courses, to have a quick guide to supplement the textbook.

The layout will be something like this:
1. Table of Contents
2. Outlines in an ADTMC format to guide the EMT
   - Scene Size Up
   - Primary assessment
   - History taking
   - Secondary assessment
   - Reassessment
3. Quick Guides 
4. In depth reference sections for individual tasks 
   - For example, Respiratory, Circulation, etc
5. Bibliography
6. Index
